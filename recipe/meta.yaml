  summary: An app to handle configuration defaults of packaged Django apps gracefully
  description: |
    A helper class for handling configuration defaults of packaged Django apps gracefully. This app precedes Django's 
    own AppConfig classes that act as "objects [to] store metadata for an application" inside Django's app loading 
    mechanism. In other words, they solve a related but different use case than django-appconf and can't easily be 
    used as a replacement. The similarity in name is purely coincidental.
